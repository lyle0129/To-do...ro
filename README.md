# To-doro

So... I was learning React and in the lesson on making a to-do list, why not 
double down and make it as a pomodoro timer since you need to be keeping track
of the things to do could be handled better with proper time management.

Hence, To-doro.

** Note: I sincerely hope you just clone the repo and run the app locally instead 
if you plan on using it for long time because I might deplete my vercel limits
if you use the app through it. **
